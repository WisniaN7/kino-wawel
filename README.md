# Kino Wawel / Wawel Cinema
## About 
The final project for the course "*WWW Techniques*" and "*Graphical Interfaces*" at the FAIS faculty at Jagiellonian University. The project is a web application for a small **imaginary cinema network**.

## How to run
1. Download the project and install XAMPP (recommended) and Node.js (if you don't have the already).
2. Run XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.
3. Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database called ``kino_wawel``.
4. Import the ``kino_wawel.sql`` file into the database.
5. Run ``npm install`` command in the project directory.
6. Open the project in your favourite IDE and run ``npm start`` in the terminal.

* Once run the app should be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* If you're having problems with the database, check ``controllers/database.js`` file and try changing the port, user or password values.
* For admin access to add and edit movies and screening in the database via application, login as admin ``{ login: admin, password: admin }``.
